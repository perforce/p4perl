# P4Perl
## Overview
P4Perl is a wrapper for the P4 C++ API in Perl.

P4Perl is a Perl module that provides an object-oriented API to Helix Core server. Using P4Perl is faster than using the command-line interface in scripts, because multiple command can be executed on a single connection, and because it returns Helix server responses as Perl hashes and arrays.

## Requirements

For P4Perl requirements see "Compatibility Statements" in [RELNOTES](https://github.com/perforce/p4perl/blob/master/RELNOTES.txt#L143)

## Documentation
Official documentation is located on the [Perforce website](https://www.perforce.com/manuals/p4perl/Content/P4Perl/Home-p4perl.html)
